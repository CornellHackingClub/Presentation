				<h1>Hello!</h1>
				<p>Cornell Hacking Club</p>

				<h2>Recruitment</h2>
				<p>We are hoping to open up recruitment this week.</p>
				<p>We need some new blood, so sooner is better.</p>
				<p>For those of you with challenges, <br> how are they coming?</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>Demos!</h2>
				<p>It would be great if we could demo the challenges.</p>
				<p>I'd like to give people a chance to work on them</p>
				<p>My web challenge is live: <a href="http://165.227.181.157">http://165.227.181.157</a></p>
				<p>Prompt: <i>It seems you can buy an interview for $100k. Maybe you can get it cheaper?</i></p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>More Demos!</h2>
				<p>Matt came in clutch with <i>two</i> challenges!</p>
				<p><b>OSINT: </b> I forget where I left my key, <br> can you git it for me?</p>
				<p>It will probably link to <a href="https://chc.cs.cornell.edu/tools">our tools page</a></p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>Matt's other challenge!</h2>
				<p>He made a sweet forensics challenge, <br>that we haven't hosted yet.</p>
				<p>We'll post the file in the slack.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>Defining Recruitment</h2>
				<p>How many weeks do we want recruitment to be open?</p>
				<p>3 sounds like a good number to me</p>
				<p>We can monitor the completions to see if we need to extend it.</p>
				<p>Also, depending of the rate of completion, <br> we could potentially publish more hints like PlaidCTF</p>
			</section>
			
			<section>
				<h2>Workshops</h2>
				<p>Let's get one on the calendar</p>
				<p>Introduction to XSS?</p>
				<p>We need to create a slide deck for it</p>
				<p>Eboard: Get the XSS demo up and running</p>
				<p>Recreate Sumner's Hooks page</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>Future Workshops</h2>
				<p>The past eboard left us a few more we can use</p>
				<ul>
					<li>SQL Injection</li>
					<li>Staying Anonymous Online</li>
					<li>Portscanning</li>
					<li>Buffer Overflows</li>
				</ul>
				<p>We should contribute to this, so we can build our educational material.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>Meetings</h2>
				<p>The meetings will continue until morale improves.</p>
				<p>But seriously, we need to come up with some projects.</p>
