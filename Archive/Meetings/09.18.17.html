				<h2>Recruitment</h2>
				<p>We are hoping to open up recruitment this week.</p>
				<p>We clearly need some new blood, so let's bring it into the club.</p>
				<p>For those of you with challenges, how are they coming?</p>
				<p>Will you be ready for us to make them live, soon?</p>

			<section>
				<h2>Demos!</h2>
				<p>It would be great if we could demo the challenges to the club.</p>
				<p>But it might be fun to give people a chance to work on them</p>
				<p>My web challenge is live: <a href="http://165.227.181.157">http://165.227.181.157</a></p>
				<p>Prompt: <i>It seems you can buy an interview for $100k. Maybe you can get it cheaper?</i></p>
