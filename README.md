# Cornell Hacking Club Presentation Repository

These presentations are powered by (Reveal.JS)[https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js]

Documentation is available there. I made a custom theme chc.css based on the default theme "blood".

To make a new presentation, copy index.html and change the <section> elements and don't forget to update the <title>.

## TODO: 

1. Define a structure so multiple presentations can be hosted in this Repo
2. Consider finding our Orator STD font in a webfont
3. Update the index with a feature reference
4. Replace index with a directory that links to all our presentations
